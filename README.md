# Pong2 with square ball

This example shows how to build a small real-time game step by
step. It demonstrates how to structure a program, store all state
in one table, update the world in small bounded time steps, and draw
the result every frame.

The approach used here also helps overcome the limited performance
of Compy hardware by keeping updates deterministic and efficient.


### 1. Files and purpose

The project has three files:

- **constants.lua** — numbers that never change: sizes, colors,
  speeds. 
- **strategy.lua** — code that decides how the right paddle moves.
  It can follow the ball (AI) or be controlled by a second player.
- **main.lua** — the main program. It sets up the screen,
  initializes state, runs the update loop and draws the picture.

Separating logic, constants, and behavior keeps the program
readable and efficient.



### 2. Constants

```lua
PADDLE_WIDTH   = 10
PADDLE_HEIGHT  = 60
BALL_SIZE      = 10
AI_DEADZONE    = 4
COLOR_FG       = {1, 1, 1}
COLOR_BG       = {0, 0, 0}
```
These numbers define proportions, not absolute pixels. The actual
paddle and ball sizes are computed in main.lua from the current
screen height, so the game scales to different displays.
They are still read-only during the run.



### 3. Game state

All moving objects and scores live in one table S:

```lua
S = {
  player = { x, y, w, h, dy },
  opp    = { x, y, w, h, dy },
  ball   = { x, y, dx, dy, size },
  playerScore = 0,
  oppScore    = 0,
  state = "start"
}
```
The program updates these values each step and then draws them.
Keeping everything together makes it easy to inspect and debug.

### 4. Setting up the screen

At startup, cache_dims() measures the screen once and stores:

```lua
screen_w  = G.getWidth()
screen_h  = G.getHeight()

local base_h = 480
local scale  = screen_h / base_h

paddle_w  = math.floor(PADDLE_WIDTH  * scale + 0.5)
paddle_h  = math.floor(PADDLE_HEIGHT * scale + 0.5)
ball_size = math.floor(BALL_SIZE     * scale + 0.5)

paddle_max_y = screen_h - paddle_h
ball_max_y   = screen_h - ball_size
center_x     = math.floor(screen_w / 2 + 0.5)
```
This way, the same proportions are kept, but real sizes follow the
actual screen size.

### 5. Drawing the scene

All drawing happens inside love.draw():
	1.	Clear the screen.
	2.	Draw the cached divider canvas.
	3.	Draw paddles, ball, and scores.
	4.	Draw text messages such as “Press Space”.

Example:
```lua
function love.draw()
  cache_dims()
  G.clear(COLOR_BG)
  G.setColor(COLOR_FG)
  G.draw(CENTER_CANVAS)
  draw_paddle(S.player)
  draw_paddle(S.opp)
  draw_ball(S.ball)
  draw_scores()
  draw_state_text()
end
```
The center divider is drawn once on a canvas. Its segment height
uses the same `ball_size` that was computed from the screen, so
the whole scene stays proportional.
Drawing only from cached data keeps rendering predictable even on
slow devices.

⸻

### 6. Input and control

The left paddle can be moved with the mouse or keys Q and A.

The right paddle uses a strategy selected at startup:
```lua
strategy.set_opp_strategy("ai")
```
for a computer opponent, or
```lua
strategy.set_opp_strategy("manual")
```
for a second human using arrow keys.

Press Space to start or restart; Escape to quit.



### 7. The update loop

`love.update(dt)` is called many times per second. The program
measures real time since the previous frame and advances the
simulation in small bounded time steps. Each integration step
uses the same duration (`FIXED_DT`), but the total number of
steps per frame is limited by `MAX_STEPS`. This prevents the game
from getting stuck if one frame takes too long.
```lua
acc = acc + rdt
while acc >= FIXED_DT and steps < MAX_STEPS do
  step_game(FIXED_DT)
  acc = acc - FIXED_DT
  steps = steps + 1
end
```
Originally this bounded-step loop was added to compensate for an
expensive per-frame screenshot on Compy. After removing that
feature, the loop is no longer strictly required for performance.
It remains good practice, because random long frames can still
happen when the garbage collector (GC) runs.

`FIXED_DT` is the duration of one physics step (1/60 s).
`MAX_STEPS` limits the number of updates per frame, ensuring
consistent gameplay across devices.


### 8. What happens in one step

Each call to step_game(dt) advances the world by one quantum of
time:
```lua
update_player(dt)
strategy.update(S, dt)
move_ball(S.ball, dt)
bounce_ball(S.ball)
collide(S.ball, S.player, S.player.w)
collide(S.ball, S.opp, -S.ball.size)
check_score()
```
These operations are simple arithmetic updates, chosen to be fast
enough for Compy’s limited processor. The combination of short
steps and minimal math gives smooth motion without heavy load.

When checking for goals, the code compares
`b.x + b.size` with `screen_w`, not with a constant, because the
ball size was scaled earlier in `cache_dims()` and copied into
`S.ball.size` during layout.


### 9. Opponent strategies

`strategy.lua` defines how the right paddle moves.

AI strategy
```lua
local d = (S.ball.y + S.ball.size/2) -
          (S.opp.y + S.opp.h/2)
if math.abs(d) > AI_DEADZONE then
  move_paddle(S.opp, (d > 0) and 1 or -1, dt)
end
```
The paddle follows the ball but pauses inside a small “dead zone”
so it does not react instantly.

Manual strategy

Reads the arrow keys:
```lua
if love.keyboard.isDown("up") then dir = -1
elseif love.keyboard.isDown("down") then dir = 1 end
move_paddle(S.opp, dir, dt)
```
Any new behavior can be added as:
```lua
strategy.set_opp_strategy("custom", function(S, dt)
  -- your logic here
end)
```
Because the module is separate, the game code stays clean.


### 10. Discrete simulation and Compy performance

The discrete, bounded-step simulation is not only a teaching tool.
It is also a performance solution.

On Compy, frame rate and CPU speed can vary between devices.
If physics were tied directly to dt, motion would become slower
or faster depending on load.

By processing time in small, bounded slices the game stays
predictable even when rendering slows down on Compy devices.

Originally, bounded updates were introduced to offset the
performance loss from taking a full-frame screenshot each cycle.
After that feature was removed, this logic became optional for
speed, yet still valuable to absorb random long frames caused by
the garbage collector (GC).

In short, discrete time keeps the game fair and efficient even
on limited hardware.


### 11. Common issues
 * Tunneling: a fast ball may skip a paddle if the time step is 
too large. Reduce ball speed or lower `FIXED_DT`.
 * Frame drop: if too many updates pile up, the loop stops at 
`MAX_STEPS` and the game slows slightly instead of freezing.
 * Mixed timing: always use fixed `dt` for physics and real `dt`
only for animation or timers.
 * High SPEED_SCALE: makes movement faster but less accurate.
 * Bounded steps also protect the game from rare GC pauses.
